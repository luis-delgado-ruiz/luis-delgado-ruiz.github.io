            <p class="questions">
                1) How did you apply (or not) iterative design in your project? <br>
                    We are not sure if it can be called iterative design, since we only did one or two iterations (when asking our partners in class if they found something that could be improved in our design, and the other when we looked for our user persona looking for what they say or need). 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2)  Describe the main highlights of your persona. Explain the audience of your project.<br>
                    Recently graduated.<br>
                    Little to no experience (without counting their professional service).<br>
                    Very saturated careers.<br>
                    Looking for a job relatively close to their homes.<br>
                    Very few contacts in business.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3)  Explain, in your own words, the three principles of system design <br>
                        Early focus in users and tasks: En esta etapa se concentra únicamente en entender la idea del proyecto, el porqué, para qué, para quién. Igualmente conocer lo que el cliente desea de este mismo proyecto. Ya sabiendo esta información, planear el desarrollo de la página web y tener claras las tareas de cada persona(grupo) y sus prioridades individuales. 
                        <br>Empirical Measurement: In this stage it is important to have a feedback of the users to ensure that the project is going on the right direction. From there the webpage is tested and analyzed to fix errors. 
                        <br>Iterative design: As it is impossible to have a perfect product in the first run it is important to fix the errors found and repeat the process of testing, until the product works as desired. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    4) Create your own methodology to develop a website. It’s important to justify all the steps.<br>
                        Chat with the client and create wireframes: It is important to always have the customer feedback to ensure that their needs are met and that the final product behaves and sees as he wishes, from there create  a visual guide of how the product form would be to be approved by the customer.
                        <br>Planning: Once the development team knows the needs of the client we plan ahead our priorities and from there create sub-teams for different tasks and a schedule for the development process.
                        <br>Prototypes: A fundamental element in the development process of  a web page are the prototypes, not only to see if the product is coming as desired but also to test it and see its errors to fix them.
                        <br> Validation of prototypes: As already said, it is vital that the client feels comfortable with the product and that it meets all their needs, just as it is important to have the validation of the development team that the project is on track as planned.
                        <br>Development: Once the stages of prototyping and validation have been completed, the project can advance to the stage of development where there is already a more concrete vision of the final product.
                        <br>Testing and feedback: Once the project is in its final stages it is very important to test it to ensure that it does not have bugs. At the same time, the client is presented with the almost finished version for his feedback and to make small changes if necessary.
                        <br>Final tests and final validation: The last tests are done to ensure that the page works optimally and the finished product is presented to the client. It is always important that the client feels involved in the development process.
                        <br>Delivery: The project is delivered to the customer.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    5) Explain the status of your project. Grade your project according to your effort (30%) and result (70%). <br>
                    The current status of our project is in the final iterations, we are checking that it gets to its optimal version, with the right amount of information, and that it looks well and it's not overwhelming. we are also looking to make it more simple. We are also looking for extra feedback on what could be done better. 
                    The effort we’ve given to this project has been great, we have all collaborated and worked as a team. In our personal capabilities we’ve given our best but there is always room for improvement and we can do better. So our grade for effort would be a 29%.
                    On results we’ve come along some problems mostly in design, we are not completely satisfied with how it looks and we are working on that. But for the most part we believe that it functions as we wanted to. For result our grade is 61%
                    Total 90%
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    6) Explain the status of your interview. Who is your expert? Why? Who is your user?<br>
                    
                    For our project, we interviewed two different users and one expert:
                    
                    <br>The expert is an employee of the department of life and career in Tec, she receives daily students that are looking for a job and she helps them looking for good options, lately the percentage of employability in the university has increase.
                    
                    <br>For our users, we interviewed two exatecs from two different careers, one of them has already a job and the other one is still looking for opportunities. Both of them believe that one of the most difficult thing to get a job when you are finishing university is the experience, many companies just focus on experience and age.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    7) Ask another team for their proposal. Compare it with yours. Which one is better? Why?<br>
                    Team: Luis Bodart, Luis Wilson
                    Bodart and Wilson proposal’s introduction is stronger and well explained which is very good as it is the first impression the client has of the development team. But as for the methodology and the implementation plan we feel that our’s works closer with the client which we think is a very important thing to have. We also take more time in prototyping and testing to ensure that it meets the clients needs and the finished product looks and works as he wanted to. So overall our proposal is better since we focus more on the clients satisfaction.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    8) Is your project responsive? Explain.<br>
                    
                    In our project our design is responsive because our page has its own simplicity, the buttons, layouts, images and information are well organized that it can be adapted to any device. It gives a facility for the users to reach the platform and use it in a more effective way. This kind of design increases the possibility to reach more people globally.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    9) In your project did you follow the first three laws of simplicity? How? <br>
                    
                        We follow the three laws of simplicity:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    When we talk about reduce, we use only key words on our project with simple explanations, reducing some extra functionality , we want our project to be easy to use and understand for the users. 
                    We organize our project in a way that, it can explain itself with an order. First, we separated every sub-topic and each of them has their own “items”. 
                    And for the third law, in order to save time,in our project we want the users to understand use and find the information the quickly as possible.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    10) Grade your second term (each member). <br>
                    Luis Delgado: 88<br>
                    Andrea Gamboa: 94<br>
                    Victor Zazueta: 90
                    <br>

      <script>
            function showGrade() {
              document.getElementById("grade").innerHTML 
              = "¡UN CIENAZO PROFESOR!<br>" +
                "AY PERO QUE BARBARO QUE BUEN EQUIPAZO SI SI SI";
            }
